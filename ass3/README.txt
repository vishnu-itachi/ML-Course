1.  Run the 1 st part of the assignment
    python ass3q1.py
    =>This will take 4 to 5 secs to run and displays clusters of both single and complete linkage.It is then stored for 3rd part using pickle.
    
2.  Run the 2nd part of the assignment
    python ass3q2.py
    =>This will take 10 to 13 secs to run and print clusters based on initial threshold given in the program.It is then stored for 3rd part using pickle.

3.  Run the 3rd part of the assignment
    python ass3q3.py
    =>This will display the NMI values of each model.
    =>Also prints each model with clusters and its length and majority class.
